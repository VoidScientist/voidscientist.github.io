            <h1> My Programming Skills : </h1>
            <div class=language>
                <h2>GDScript</h2>
                <p> A language similar to Python that you might not know. It is a scripting language exclusive to the opensource project regarding game making : the Godot Engine. I've focused on it for some time now, as I've made some game, and lots of prototypes in Godot.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="language">
                <h2> Python </h2>
                <p> My main language when it comes to programming. I have experience using it to implement genetic algorithm or to handle data. (i.e: Random Idea Generator)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="language">
                <h2> Lua </h2>
                <p> I'm currently working with Lua a bit as a way to move on from Python and broaden my skills. For example, I'm currently working on a video game project using the Love2D engine.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="language">
                <h2> Ruby </h2>
                <p> I really like Ruby, but I've never used it for a serious project yet. Nonetheless, I have still used it when it comes to competitive programming, in case of writing the shortest code, for example. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="language">
                <h2>Java (Processing)</h2>
                <p> When it comes to Java, I have some experience with it, but only using Processing 4. For example, I've made the "Ultimate Tic Tac Toe" game using it, and even though it isn't much, I find it fun to use. Maybe I'll consider making a project in pure Java someday.</p>
